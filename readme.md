# Southwest (WN) Point Value Userscript

The purpose of this simple script is to display the variable points per dollar
for a Southwest point redemption flight.

Currently, as of 5/1/2016, this range is 72-80 points per dollar.

According to [nsx@Flyertalk](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/26549270-post18.html),
the number of points per dollar increases roughly every April.

To run this script, open the raw version of script.js, and paste it into the console
window of your browser after you have done a fare search on Southwest.

The script will display a breakdown as shown below:
